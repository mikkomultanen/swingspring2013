The fearless Swing Spring commando squad has performed a successful T-shirt raid! A high quality shirt of fresh spring green hue was carefully selected to be worthy of the gorgeous Swing Spring 2013 logo. Separate models for men and women are available.

<h3>10-11-2012 Swing Spring is here again!</h3>
<p>
We are happy to confirm that there will be another Swing Spring dance camp in May 2013! 
Once again the camp will take place at Himos, Jämsä, with beautiful views, cottages with saunas etc. Our mission is to make the camp at least as awesome as it was last time, be it in terms of teaching, partying or practical arrengements.
</p>
<p>
We will be using the same pricing system as last time, meaning that the quicker you register, the cheaper your camp will be. Information on registering and other camp related things will first be sent to last year's participants and the members of Swing Spring Facebook group. So, join in and welcome to Swing Spring 2013!

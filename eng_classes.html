<h1 class="page-header">Classes</h1>

<p>
Swing Spring 2013 is a Lindy Hop camp, meaning that Lindy Hop will be taught daily. In addition to Lindy, we will have elective classes and bonbons on other dances or subjects, so that they promote the general idea of the camp. 
</p>

<h2>Beginners</h2>
<p>
We will also be giving a lindy hop beginners class. The lessons will take place on Friday night before the party and on Saturday during day time. The price will also include all parties. Price: 60€ + 10€, the membership fee of Rock'n'Swing Dance Club Break ry. There is a 10€ discount if you register as a couple.
</p>

<h2 id="camp">The Full Camp</h2>
<p>
There will be approximately five hours of classes every day, though we will have more classes the first three days. On Sunday, the schedule will be shorter. A more detailed schedule will be published before the camp.
</p>
<p>
The classes are meant for all lindy hoppers who have participated in a (half-yearish) beginners' course. You don't need to choose your level while registering, as we will divide the participants into groups during the first class. The actual level of each group will depend on the general level of the camp. The division into groups will be done individually, so if you'd like to be in the same group as your partner, but you end up in different groups, please contact Aleksis after the first class.

<h2>What is the teaching like at Swing Spring?</h2>
<p>
For the teaching on Swing Spring last year, we tried something new that has never been done on a swing dance camp in Finland before (to our knowledge): during a weekend, all teachers put their heads together to figure out general guidelines and themes for the teaching at the camp, on the basis of the current Finnish (and international) swing scene. Therefore, while all the classes are different from each other, they create a whole. The idea is to learn by doing and to understand new things about dancing, while dancing.

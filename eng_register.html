<h1 class="page-header">Register</h1>

<p>
Our registration is open! It's best to register with a partner, because that way you get partner discount and as a follow, you will confirm your spot. Your partner doesn't need to be on the same level as you. The registration is unfortunately closed for single followers since our waiting list is already on the long side.

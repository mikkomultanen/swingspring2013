<h1 class="page-header">Competitions</h1>

<p>
Two different lindy hop competitions will be arranged during Swing Spring 2013. Both of
them are improvised social dance contests so no choreographies or special skills are required. 
Competition entry is included in the prices of the camp and party tickets, though a qualifying 
round may be arranged in the early evening before the party starts. The best way to register for 
the competitions is to do it while registering for the event but it's also possible via email: <span class="email" data="115,120,107,113,107,120,118,121,113,119,113,75,120,118,124,115,137,121,129,131,66,123,127">swingspring (at) lindyhop . fi</span>.

<h2>Thursday 9.5. Jack’n’Jill</h2>
<p>
A fun competition for all swing dancers in which pairs are shuffled at random. It's a great opportunity to get to know other participants at the start of the camp!

<h2>Saturday 11.5. Strictly Lindy Hop</h2>
<p>
A competition for all lindy hoppers for which you register with a partner. We will have a lottery between all couples for two Herräng party passes this summer.

<h2>What is the teaching like at Swing Spring?</h2>
<p>
Swing Spring 2013 is a Lindy Hop camp, meaning that Lindy Hop will be taught daily. In addition to Lindy, we will have elective classes and bonbons on other dances or subjects, so that they promote the general idea of the camp. 
</p>
<p>
For the teaching on Swing Spring last year, we tried something new that has never been done on a swing dance camp in Finland before (to our knowledge): during a weekend, all teachers put their heads together to figure out general guidelines and themes for the teaching at the camp, on the basis of the current Finnish (and international) swing scene. Therefore, while all the classes are different from each other, they create a whole. The idea is to learn by doing and to understand new things about dancing, while dancing. 
</p>
<p>
There will be approximately five hours of classes every day, though we will have more classes the first three days. On Sunday, the schedule will be shorter. A more detailed schedule will be published before the camp.

During the 90′s, <b>Minna Marttila</b> had to take a break from Judo and during that time fell in love with swing dancing. And she never looked back. Her journey in the swing world started with Boogie Woogie soon followed by Lindy Hop and later on by the elegant but spicy Balboa. She is the proud mother of the eight years old “Puistotanssit – Lindy in the Park” in her home town Helsinki. Promoting social dancing is close to her heart.

<b>Aleksis Nokso-Koivisto</b> is one of the most well-known Lindy Hoppers in Finland. Since 1995, he’s tried most Rock’n’Swing dances and other dances as well, but his dancing and teaching is also inspired by music and other performing arts. His classes are above all physical, because the only way to learn to dance is to dance. However, this must be done with thought: deliberate practice is the only way to mastery.

<img src="hanna-reetta.jpg"/>
<b>Hanna-Reetta Nokso-Koi&shy;vis&shy;to</b> has danced many dances during her dancing career of over ten years, but the versatile and challenging Lindy Hop has proved to be her favourite. Every dance is a unique experience to be lived in the moment. As a life-long learner, Hanna-Reetta has an unending thirst for challenging herself in classes both home and abroad, as she believes one can always learn more! In dancing and teaching, she believes in the “holy trinity” between the dance partners and the music. Each of the three have an important role and everything affects everything. Partner communication begins with the understanding and control of one’s own body.

Saku’s dance program also includes Tap dancing and Argentinian Tango. His trademarks are energetic dancing and a love for social dancing, but he sees himself doing more shows and choreographies in future.

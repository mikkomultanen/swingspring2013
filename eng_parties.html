There will be total of four nights of dancing during Swing Spring 2013, starting from Wednesday until Saturday! During this time we'll also have exciting competitions and performances. Our official camp band will be Jimbino Vegan and the Jazz Cannibals from New Orleans. Many dancers know Jimmy from his earlier visits to Finland with the band called Too Dumb To Die. In addition to them we will have the very best swing DJs in Finland playing for you!
